# OWASP Security Guide for SimpleIdentityServer.API

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive security checklist for SimpleIdentityServer.API based on OWASP API Security Top 10 and general security best practices. The recommendations are tailored specifically to the current implementation using OpenIddict and ASP.NET Core.

## Current Security Assessment

### ✅ Already Implemented
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect with OpenIddict
- Client credentials flow
- HTTPS redirection
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Client secret validation
- Token introspection endpoint
- **Production certificates** - Proper certificate handling in production environment
- **Comprehensive rate limiting** - Global and endpoint-specific rate limiting with configurable limits
- **Security logging** - Serilog-based structured logging with SQL Server storage and 30-day retention
- **Security monitoring** - Real-time monitoring of token requests and suspicious activities
- **Request size limits** - 1MB body size limits and connection throttling (100 concurrent connections)
- **Database security** - Command timeouts (30s) and connection retry logic

- **Authorization policies** - Scope-based authorization implemented in Resource.API
- **Global exception handling** - Formal UseExceptionHandler middleware with SecurityMonitoringMiddleware integration

### ⚠️ Needs Immediate Attention
- **Input validation on API models** - No validation attributes on request DTOs/models (configuration validation is implemented)
- **Transport security requirements** - Still disabled in Resource.API (`RequireHttpsMetadata = false`)

## OWASP API Security Top 10 - Action Items

### 1. API1:2023 - Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)

**Current Risk**: Medium - Limited endpoints but no explicit object-level checks

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Implement resource-based authorization for all endpoints
- [ ] Add user context validation in TokenController
- [ ] Create authorization policies for different client types
- [ ] Implement proper scope validation for resource access

```csharp
// Example implementation needed in controllers
[Authorize(Policy = "RequireClientScope")]
public class TokenController : ControllerBase
{
    // Add proper authorization checks
}
```

### 2. API2:2023 - Broken Authentication

**Current Risk**: Medium - Production certificates implemented, but some transport security issues remain

**Actions Required**:
- [x] ~~**CRITICAL**: Replace development certificates with production certificates~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Production certificates now properly configured
- [ ] Remove `DisableTransportSecurityRequirement()` in production - **Still present in Resource.API**
- [ ] Implement certificate rotation strategy
- [ ] Add multi-factor authentication for administrative functions
- [ ] Strengthen client secret requirements (minimum length, complexity)

**Code Changes Needed**:
```csharp
// In Program.cs - Replace this block for production:
options.AddDevelopmentEncryptionCertificate()
       .AddDevelopmentSigningCertificate();

// With:
options.AddEncryptionCertificate(GetProductionEncryptionCertificate())
       .AddSigningCertificate(GetProductionSigningCertificate());
```

### 3. API3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization

**Current Risk**: Medium - Limited data exposure but no field-level controls

**Actions Required**:
- [x] Implement field-level authorization in API responses
- [x] Add data filtering based on client permissions
- [x] Review token introspection response for sensitive data exposure
- [x] Implement response filtering middleware

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `FieldLevelAuthorizationAttribute` for controller-level filtering
- Implemented `ResponseFilteringMiddleware` for JSON response filtering
- Enhanced token introspection to limit sensitive data exposure based on client trust levels
- Added field-level authorization rules based on client roles and permissions
- Created comprehensive testing script to validate field-level controls

**Security Controls Added**:
1. **Response Filtering**: Middleware automatically filters JSON responses based on user claims
2. **Field-Level Rules**: Configurable permissions for sensitive fields (temperature, humidity, internal IDs)
3. **Client-Based Access**: Different data exposure levels for service, web, and mobile clients
4. **Introspection Protection**: Limited token details based on requesting client's trust level
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: PowerShell script to validate all field-level authorization scenarios

### 4. API4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption

**Current Risk**: Low - Comprehensive resource controls implemented

**Actions Required**:
- [x] ~~**CRITICAL**: Implement rate limiting middleware~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Global and endpoint-specific rate limiting implemented

- [x] ~~Add timeout configurations for database operations~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - 30-second command timeout with retry logic
- [x] ~~Monitor and limit token generation frequency~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Token request monitoring with suspicious activity detection

**Implementation Example**:
```csharp
// Add to Program.cs
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(options =>
{
    options.GlobalLimiter = PartitionedRateLimiter.Create<HttpContext, string>(
        httpContext => RateLimitPartition.GetFixedWindowLimiter(
            partitionKey: httpContext.User.Identity?.Name ?? httpContext.Request.Headers.Host.ToString(),
            factory: partition => new FixedWindowRateLimiterOptions
            {
                AutoReplenishment = true,
                PermitLimit = 100,
                Window = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)
            }));
});

// Add to pipeline
app.UseRateLimiter();
```

### 5. API5:2023 - Broken Function Level Authorization
